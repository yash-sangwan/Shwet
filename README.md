# Shwet

## Overview

**Shwet** is a blockchain-based network inspired by the concept of the **Truth Chain** introduced by Reclaim Protocol. The platform allows users to store and share data such as facts, figures, news, media, and claims from various sources, including individuals, organizations, and public figures. Each piece of information is accompanied by an attested proof of authentication that ensures its integrity. Once recorded, the data cannot be modified or retracted by anyone, including the author or Shwet itself.

## Features

- **Immutable Data Storage**: Information stored on the blockchain cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity.
- **Attestation of Facts**: All facts, figures, and claims are accompanied by proof of authentication.
- **Decentralized Network**: The network operates on the Solana blockchain, ensuring high security and transparency.
- **Fast Transactions**: Leveraging Solanaâ€™s high throughput, transactions on Shwet are processed quickly, making data storage and retrieval efficient.
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Thanks to Solana's low transaction fees, users can interact with Shwet without worrying about high costs.
- **Proof of Authentication**: All data entries are securely verified and stored on the blockchain, ensuring credibility.
- **Global Accessibility**: The platform is accessible to individuals, organizations, and public figures worldwide, promoting a decentralized flow of verified information.
